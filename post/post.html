                    99%‚Äôers. The 1% are the wealthiest in the world; Gates,
                    Bezos, Musk etc.‚Ä¶ They have thriving businesses, but more
                    importantly, they live life on their terms. If you‚Äôre
                    reading this, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre working a 9-5 and fit into
                    the 99%‚Äôer club.

                    The key to success is working smart, <em>not hard</em>. Most
                    people believe success equates to hard work, grinding from
                    dawn ‚Äòtill dusk. ‚ÄîIs there an escape from the 9-5 continuum?
                    Certainly,OX App is where anyone can start.

                    OX is a new economy of wealth based on trading data points
                    and actions of an individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OX doesn‚Äôt just show members how to gain wealth- the App
                    gives individuals the tools and platform to make that
                    happen, the easiest and fastest way possible.
                  </p>
                  <h4><strong>INTRODUCING ‚ÄòOX‚Äô</strong></h4>
                  <p>
                    Built on web 3, OX is a free earningApp, developed for Gen Z
                    to earn a livelihood and build wealth with passive income
                    streams from their personal data and time - directly from a
                    smart phone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes OX unique is its users data Protection,
                    guaranteed through a decentralised Data Vault‚Ñ¢, backed
                    byBlockchain and NFT technology. This makes OX a stand-alone
                    trailblazer compared to other Apps of a similar genre. Why?
                    Simple. OX doesn‚Äôt store users data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, data rights are given directly to the users through
                    legally binding smart contracts. This safety bolt allows
                    users to keep their data on their own device; ensuring users
                    get the best in self-regulatory data privacy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    ‚ÄúOX uses the same strategy as a trade off for its users; the
                    more people brought to the app to build up the platform, the
                    more rewards the users get‚Äù.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first way to earn is through OX‚Äôs limited issuance of
                    YOOX Tokens for early adopters. YOOX Tokens are digital
                    assets, otherwise known as OX equity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    YOOX tokens are equivalent to Charlie and the chocolate
                    factory‚Äôs Golden ticket- they‚Äôre a rare chance for early
                    users to gain share ownership in the App‚ÄîMeaning, users can
                    become instant part owners in OX simply by signing up
                    friends!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wonder why the early members reward is so substantial? OX‚Äôs
                    inauguration campaign is to grow its user base extensively,
                    not only to gain brand awareness but also to enable other
                    features on the App to be initiated.

                  <p>How can users get their hands on YOOX tokens?</p>

                  <p>
                    OX‚Äôs parallel earning feature is the 1-MinuteAction
                    Marketplace where users earn OXIT coins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OXIT Coins will become a highly tradable asset just like
                    Bitcoin or any other crypto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The value of the coins are derived and backed from OX‚Äôs fund
                    that is created from user data, managed by the App.As the OX
                    fund increases, so does the value of OXIT coins. Users will
                    be ableto buy and sell based on this value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the OX user base grows, the OXIT marketplace develops,
                    with new actions added daily that will also increase in
                    value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Users earn OXIT coins for anonymous and verified data added
                    with 1-minute actions, gaining 1 OXIT per 15 seconds of
                    time. OX‚Äôs 1-minute action feature unifies commerce with
                    consumers through Humanthink‚Ñ¢ behavioural science-akin to
                    digital matchmaking.
